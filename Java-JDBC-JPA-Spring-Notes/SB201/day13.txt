  sending data to the server along with http request:
=====================================

--from the browser we send the request using either GET or POST 

GET:
--by typing in the URL 
--clicking on hyperlink 
--by clicking on button 

POST: 

--by submitting the form
--if we try to upload any file

****--Using GET also we can send the data, if we send the data using 
GET method, that data will travel through url.
where as if we send the data using POST method then that data 
will travel using Http request body.

In Webservices we can send following types of request also.
PUT
DELETE



1. request parameter: (name-value pair)  (GET/DELETE/POST/DELETE)

/index.jsp?roll=123&name=ram   // query string


2.path parameter: it does not have the key  (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE)

/index.jsp/123/ram

3.by using request body:  (POST/PUT)

jsondata 

{
"roll": 123,
"name": "Ram",
"marks": 500
}


xmldata


<student>
<roll>123</roll>
<name>Ram</name>
<marks>850</marks>
</student>

formdata:

--by submitting the form page or uploading any file(POST/ PUT)



Spring MVC:
===========

****In Spring Boot, rest api development will work based on Spring MVC architecture.


if we develop a webapplication according to the mvc architecture manually, we need to develop Servlet class, jsp file and all the flow control logic manually.

Spring f/w provides Spring-web-mvc module to simplify the manual mvc application development.
in which , Spring mvc module provides a predefined Servlet class with predefined flow control logic , ie. DispatcherServlet class.

Spring Boot:
==========

--it is a spring platform that mainly focus on convenstion over configuration.

--It is not a f/w s/w, it is just a spring application development platform which 
provides RAD(Rapid Application development) feature to the Spring f/w.

--Spring boot support auto-configuration.

--it provides integrated tomcat server, so we can develop webapplication/webservices without installing WebServer.

--with the help of Spring boot, we can develop WA, WS, microservices , Spring cloud based application very easily.



Spring : java based application framework

Spring Core: base module of Spring f/w (IOC container , DI)

Spring-MVC : It is a spring module to develop java based WA/WS (simplyfy the 
process by providing DispatcherServlet class with predefined flow control).

Spring Boot: It is a platform which simplyfy the Spring application development 
--it provides integrated tomcat server.


There are various ways to use spring boot to develop a Spring application:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. installing STS

2.Installing STS plugin in another IDE 

3.by using Spring initializer website

4 by using maven or graddle application

5 using command line


using STS :--

Developing a simple Spring application using Spring Boot in STS:
==================================================


@SpringBootApplication
// @Configuration  + @ComponentScan + @EnableAutoConfiguration




Webservices:
===========

--A Service that can be accesed over the web is known as webservice.

--WA can also be accessed over the web but there r some diff :-

1.WA are meant for end-user and to be accessed by browser in human readable form.
whereas WS r meant for application to access the raw data in form of json,xml, plain text,etc.

2.A WA can accesss the WS to get some data or to perform some task whereas WS can not access the WA to get some data.

3.A Single WS can be used by diff kind of applications (developed in any technologies like Java, .Net, Python, PHP, ) whereas WA is not meant for reusablity.


WS r categorised in 2 category:
---------------------------------------
1. SOAP based WS
2.Restfull WS.


1. SOAP based WS: (Simple Object Access Protocol)
========================================

--it is a xml based protocol, to communicate bt client application to the server application, since it is xml based , it is also platform and language independent.

<student>
<roll>100</roll>
<name>Ram</name>
<marks>850</marks>
</student>

WSDL file (it is also an xml file in which we describe all the services which we expose to the client)

--creating a WS using SOAP are heavy weight application, becoz apart from creating the WS classes (actual service) there is a need to create some extra binding classes to parse the xml and convert them in java object.
and vice-versa, and moreever to expose and consume the webservices we need to generate some xml file (WSDL file) which little complex file.


--in order to make WS as light weight, another architectural style is defined named as REST (Representational State Transfer)


--This REST architectural style tells that create a WS with the requeired operations/functionalities and expose them through the Http protocol . and allow them to be accessed by the client with the help of Http protocol without any extra binding classes and any xml files.


--based on this architectural style sun-microsystem has released JAX-RS api for 
creating and consuming the RESTfull webservices.

--this JAX-RS api has diff implementaions are there (Jersey, RestEasy)




Rules to make a java class as Restfull WS:
================================
JAX-RS  api -----> Jersey, RestEasy  


--in restfull ws, A WS class is called as "rootresource" class and each method (service) of that class is called as "resource".

1. each resource (method/service) of a ws class should contain an addressable uri, that can be accessed by http protocol.

2. while exposing the Restfull WS we need to take the support the Http protocol methods:

ex:

GET: if we want to create a service that returns some info/data to the client then we define that service and expose that service with the help GET method of Http protocol.

POST: getting/accepting  the data from the client and stroing or inserting the data. 

PUT : getting/accepting some data from the client and update the existing data.

DELETE : to delete some information from the server side.


3. every restfull service class must be public and it must contains zero argument constructor.

4.webservice method should consume or return the data in the form of following format.


text/plain
application/xml
application/json   -- mosty used type


--to make a java class as a Restfull WS, we need to use JAX-RS api and one of its implementation (jersey, RestEasy) , outside of Spring environment.

--Spring f/w itself has provided its own api with the implementation to make a Spring bean (Controller class, the class which is annotated with @Controller annotation) as a restfull WS class.


***Spring MVC- provides a DispatcherServlet (predefined servlet with all the flow control logic), but without Spring boot, if we try to create a Spring-mvc project then developer need to configure this DispatcherServlet inside thier application.

--but with the Spring Boot, DispatcherServlet is already configured as a front controller of our application.
furthur more Spring boot also provides integrated tomcat server to deploy our application.


Steps to develop Spring Boot Restfull WS :
===================================

step1: create a new spring starter project:

step2: add the spring-web dependencies from next screen.

****Note: this web-dependency will integrate embedded tomcat server + predefined autoconfigured DispatcherServlet class.

Note: tomcat server run on the default port 8080

--8080 is a common port, it is recomended to change this port number before starting our application.

go to the application.properties file:

server.port=8888


http://localhost:8888/hello    

type of the request : http request
request method: GET
request : /hello


example:

MyController.java:
-----------------------

package com.masai;

//@Controller
@RestController
public class MyController {

	
	
	@RequestMapping("/hello")
	//@ResponseBody
	public String sayHello() {
		return "welcome"; //here it will be represented as raw data
	}
	
	
}



returning Student object to the client:
------------------------------------------------


//@Controller
@RestController
public class MyController {

	
	
	@RequestMapping("/hello")
	//@ResponseBody
	public String sayHello() {
		return "welcome"; //here it will be represented as raw data
	}
	
	
}



http://localhost:8888/student

output: json data 

{"roll":10,"name":"Ram","marks":780}

or

{
"roll": 10,
"name": "Ram",
"marks": 780
}
